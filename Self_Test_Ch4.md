One is a senior executive with a global manufacturer, and the other owns a sandwich shop in the college town. Global executive: “We include sustainability in our corporate mission and have a chief sustainability officer on the senior management team. The CSO is really good and makes sure that we don’t do environmental care. It sounds like you do just enough to avoid public scrutiny.

We, for example, use only natural foods and ingredients, recycle everything that is recyclable, and compost all possible waste.” Question: If you were establishing a new position called corporate sustainability officer, what would you create?
