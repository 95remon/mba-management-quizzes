## Page 2: Course Structure & Organization Dimensions
- **Grading Breakdown**:
    - 10 Marks: Attendance
    - 20 Marks: Classworks
    - 30 Marks: Midterm (Takehome exam)
    - 40 Marks: Final Exam (2 hrs online, Open book)
- **Definition**: Management is about **mindset** and **decision making**.
- **Organization Components**:
    1.  **People** (Intangible elements): Behavior, Culture, Attitude, Mindset, Perception, Communication.
    2.  **Processes** (Technical part): Hierarchy, steps.

## Page 3: Open System & Definition
- **Open System**: Organization interacts with **External Environment** (Regulations, Economic Conditions).
    - Organization affects market (Innovation, new products).
- **Definition of Organization**: Collection of **People** (functions, depts, divisions) working together (Coordination, Communication, Information flow, Interactions) to achieve a **Common Goal**.
- Note: Understanding the process allows designing the jobs/functions required.

## Page 4: Functions & Design
- **Functions** = Jobs = **Hierarchy** (Reporting system, Comm channels, Line of inf flows).
- **Process** = Jobs (Design for certain steps to get required output).
- **Design Logic**: Design organization based on "Logic":
    - Choose people with required skills -> based on Function -> based on Design of Relationships -> Controls -> Communication Channels.
    - Goal: To achieve Common Goals -> **Vision** (Goals, Objectives).

## Page 5: Socio-Technical System
- **Two Dimensions**:
    1.  **Social Dimension** (People/Intangibles).
    2.  **Process/System Dimension** (Methods/Tangibles).
- **Layers of Influence**:
    - Individual <-> Group <-> Organization.
    - Mutual influence: Individuals affect groups, groups affect organization, and vice versa.
    - Relevance to **OB (Organizational Behavior)** course.
- **Key Outcome**: Performance of the organization and achievement of Strategy/Vision.

## Page 6: Individual Performance
- **Individual**: Should be "**Job Fit**".
    - Requires: Assessment of Performance, Training, Development.
    - Tool: "**Performance Appraisals**".
- **Performance Definition**: Results/Achievements (Objectives).
    - **Effectiveness** (The "What"): Set appropriate objectives/outcome + Achieve that objective.
    - **How to Achieve**: Depends on Resources, Methods, Operations, Capabilities, Technology.
    - **Efficiency** (The "How"): Use of available resources to achieve results with **minimum waste**.

## Page 7: Ultimate Performance
- **Ultimate Performance**: High Efficiency + High Effectiveness.
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**:
    - "If I have clarity in 'What & How', then I can formulate KPIs related to the required."
    - KPIs: Check, Monitor, Measures -> Reflect What & How.

## Page 8: Continuous Improvement (PDCA)
- **PDCA Cycle** (Plan - Do - Check - Act). **Iterative Process**.
    1.  **Plan**: Strategy, timeframe, objectives, accountability, cost. (Provides Clarity/Direction).
    2.  **Do**: Plan into action (Implement). Day-to-day activity, operation, policies.
    3.  **Check**: Check Do vs. Plan. "What executed till now, brings me closer to achieving the goal."
    4.  **Act**: Change/Improvement. Adjust the plan or implementation.
- **Purpose**: Pinpoint the weakness point to change/modify or develop.

## Page 9: Organizational Levels
- **Levels**:
    1.  **Top**: BOD, Executives, Directors. (Objectives, Strategies).
    2.  **Middle**: Divisions/Sectors Managers. (Objective by division).
    3.  **First/Operational**: Project managers, team leaders. (Operational).
    4.  **Employees**: Non-managerial.
- **PDCA application**: Applied at *every* level but with different proportions.
- **Causality**:
    - "What happened in employees' level considered **Cause** for first level."
    - First level = Cause for Middle level.
    - Middle level = Cause for Top level.

## Page 10: Proactive vs. Reactive
- **Proactive Approach**:
    - PDCA method is considered Proactive.
    - Agility to adjust/adapt process/plan (not rigid).
    - Planning ahead.
    - Feedback loops available.
    - Organization always prepared.
- **Reactive Approach**:
    - "See the problem but it is not necessary to tackle it now."
    - Waiting for issues to arise from inside the organization.
- **Performance Measurement System (Control System)** -> KPIs.
    - Control = check points and frequency determined in Planning Phase.
- **Governance**: Part of this control system.
- **Real Practice**: Works with **Both** approaches (Proactive & Reactive).

- **Relationship**:
    - External changes drive internal changes.

## Pages 29-30: Evolution of Management Thought
- **1. Classical School**:
    - **Scientific Management (Taylorism)**:
        - Frederick Taylor & Henry Ford.
        - Focus: **Process**, **Efficiency**, Productivity.
        - **Time and Motion Study**: Document steps/time -> Redesign -> Standardize (**SOP**: Standard Operating Procedure).
        - Goal: Enhance efficiency (less time/waste).
        - **Critique**: Neglects the **Human Factor**.
        - Method: Breakdown process into simplified tasks (Specialized Jobs).

- **Classical School (Cont.)**:
    - **Administrative Principles (Henry Fayol)**: 14 Principles. Management Functions.
    - **Bureaucracy (Max Weber)**.
    - Note: All Classical approaches focused on **Structure** and **Coordination**.

- **2. Behavioral School**:
    - Focus: **People**, **Social**. Participation of workers ("Empowerment").
    - **Hawthorne Studies** (Elton Mayo):
        - Studied effect of work conditions on productivity.
        - Result (**Hawthorne Effect**): Relation between **Leadership** and Employees (Influence, Motivation) increases productivity. Group effect on individuals.
    - **Maslow's Hierarchy**.
    - **Theory X & Theory Y** (Douglas McGregor):
        - **Theory X (Authoritarian)**:
            - Leader Perception: Employee is lazy, avoids responsibility, needs control/threat.
            - Result: Employee is **Passive**, dependent, fearful, immature.
        - **Theory Y (Participative)**:
            - Leader Perception: Employee can learn, is accountable. Leader shares knowledge/trust.
            - Result: Employee is **Active**, empowered, independent, innovative.

## Pages 34-35: Perception & Contingency
- **Perception**:
    - Process: Stimuli -> Collect Info (incomplete) -> Process in mind -> Judgment.
    - Occurs in short time. Vulnerable to **Bias** and **Stereotyping**.
    - Critical for Managers in: Hiring, Evaluation, Interaction.
    - Manager's Role: Influence how employee perceives the organization to get required behavior.
- **Synthesis**:
    - Classical (Technical/Process) + Behavioral (Social/People) = **Socio-Technical System**.
- **Contingency Thinking**:
    - "What if...". Situational.
    - **No single best way to manage**. The best decision fits the **Situation**.
- **Leadership Branding**: You have an identity.
