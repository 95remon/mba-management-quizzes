## Essay Question
20. Two businesswomen, former college roommates, are discussing their jobs and careers over lunch. You overhear one saying to the other: “I work for a large corporation, while you own a small retail business. In my company there is a strong corporate culture and everyone feels its influence. In fact, we are always expected to act in ways that support the culture and serve as role models for others to do so as well. This includes a commitment to diversity and multiculturalism. Because of the small size of your firm, things like corporate culture, diversity, and multiculturalism are not so important to worry about.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Why?
