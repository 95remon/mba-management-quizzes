# Lecture 4: Analysis (Final Lecture)

## Lecture Overview
- **Main Topics**:
    1.  Organization Design and Change.
    2.  Leadership and Motivation.
- **Context**: This is the implementation phase of strategy (The "How").
    - **Structure follows Strategy**.

## 1. Strategy Implementation: Organizing
- **Organizing**: Allocating resources (financial & non-financial) to achieve goals.
- **Includes**: Organization Design, Organization Structure, Leadership Practices.

### Organization Design vs. Structure
- **Organization Design**: The "Big Picture". Includes processes, systems, people skills, performance measures, job design, reward systems (HR practices), culture, decision making, and leadership.
- **Organization Structure**: The "Visual Representation" (Graph).
    - Shows grouping of departments (Division of Labor).
    - Shows lines of authority/reporting (Coordination/Channel of Communication).

### Job Design
- **Definition**: The starting point of organizing. Process analysis -> Job Analysis -> Job Design.
- **Job Description**: Final tasks (Do).
- **Job Responsibilities**: Decisions (Decisions).
- **Job Fit**: Selecting the right employee (Specification).
- **approaches**:
    1.  **Simplification** (Tailorism): Worker does 1 or 2 simple tasks. High specialization. Good for control.
    2.  **Job Enlargement (Horizontal Loading)**: Increasing the number of tasks. "More of the same". Adds variety but not depth.
    3.  **Job Enrichment (Vertical Loading)**: Adding decision-making power, responsibility, and authority. "Empowerment".
- **Job Characteristics Model (Key dimensions for motivation)**:
    1.  **Skill Variety**: Using different skills.
    2.  **Task Identity**: Doing a whole piece of work (implied).
    3.  **Task Significance**: Meaningful work.
    4.  **Autonomy**: Freedom/Authority (Leads to Esteem/Self-Actualization).
    5.  **Feedback**: Knowing how well one is performing.

### types of Organization Structure
1.  **Functional Structure**:
    - Grouping by task/process (e.g., Engineering, Accounting).
    - **Pros**: Technical specialization, deep knowledge.
    - **Cons**: Silos, lack of communication between departments.
2.  **Divisional Structure**:
    - Grouping by output/goal (e.g., Product, Customer, Market).
    - **Focus**: Better serve the specific market/customer.
3.  **Matrix Structure**:
    - Hybrid of Functional and Divisional. Two bosses (Dual reporting).
4.  **Network Structure**:
    - Technology-based (e.g., Uber, Airbnb).
    - Core organization outsources unnecessary activities. Network of partners.

### Mechanistic vs. Organic Design (Contingency Theory)
- **Mechanistic**: Centralized, many rules, narrow span of control, specialized tasks, formal. (Bureaucracy/Cost Leadership).
- **Organic**: Decentralized, few rules, wide span of control, shared tasks, informal. (Adaptive/Differentiation).

## 2. Change Management
- **Lewin’s Change Management Model**:
    1.  **Unfreeze**: Preparing for change. Breaking resistance. urgency.
    2.  **Change (Transform)**: The "Do" phase. Improving or Restructuring. Leadership is key here for motivation.
    3.  **Refreeze**: Reinforcing the new behavior. New performance measures and rewards.
- **Types of Change**:
    - **Incremental**: Minor improvements (ISO, NCRs).
    - **Transformational**: Major restructuring. High resistance.
- **Resistance to Change**:
    - **Factors**: Fear, Power loss, Formalization/Rigidity.
    - **Force Field Analysis**: Drivers (Push for change) vs. Resistance (Push back). Success if Drivers > Resistance.
    - **Tactics to minimize resistance**:
        - Create Urgency.
        - Communication & Awareness.
        - Participation/Involvement.
        - Training & Capability building.
        - Reinforcement & Rewards.

## 3. Leadership & Motivation
- **Leadership**: Influencing and inspiring others to achieve goals.
- **Sources of Power**:
    1.  **Position Power** (Hierarchy):
        - Logitimate (Official).
        - Reward (Give bonuses).
        - Coercive (Punish).
        - *Note*: Short-term effect.
    2.  **Personal Power** (Within Person):
        - Referent (Role model, admiration).
        - Expert (Knowledge, Skills).
        - *Note*: Long-term effect.
    3.  **Information Power**.
    4.  **Political Power**.

### Leadership Styles & Theories
- **Behavioral Styles (Grid)**:
    - **Autocratic**: High Task, Low People. Control, Orders.
    - **Human Relations**: Low Task, High People. Comfortable atmosphere.
    - **Laissez-Faire**: Low Task, Low People. Passive.
    - **Democratic**: High Task, High People. Participation.

### Situational Leadership (Hersey-Blanchard)
- Matches leadership style to follower readiness (Competence/Capability & Commitment/Motivation):
    1.  **Telling (Directing)**: For Low People, High Task needs. (Note: Slide notes imply "Not Capable, Not Motivated" needs Telling/Direction).
    2.  **Selling (Coaching)**: For High People, High Task needs. (Slide notes imply "Not Capable, Motivated" needs Selling).
    3.  **Participating (Supporting)**: For High People, Low Task needs. (Slide notes imply "Capable, Not Motivated").
    4.  **Delegating**: For Low People, Low Task needs. (Slide notes imply "Capable, Motivated").

### Path-Goal Theory
- Leader adjusts behavior to complement situational contingencies.
- Styles: Directive, Supportive, Achievement-oriented, Participative.
