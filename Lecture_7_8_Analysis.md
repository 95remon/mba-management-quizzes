# Lecture 7 & 8 Analysis: Organization, Change, and Leadership

## Slide 1: Title
*   Management Role of the Information Professional.
*   Lecture 7 & 8 by Prof. Riham Adel.

## Slide 2: Global Organizations
*   **Definitions**:
    *   **Global Village**: Boundaryless world.
    *   **MNC**: Operations in multiple countries.
    *   **Multidomestic Corp**: Decentralized management to local country.
    *   **Global Corp**: Centralized management in home country.
    *   **Transnational Organization**: Borderless, eliminates artificial geographical barriers.
*   **Global Integration vs Local Responsiveness (Bartlett & Ghoshal)**:
    *   **Global Strategy**: High Integration, Low Responsiveness.
    *   **Transnational Strategy**: High Integration, High Responsiveness.
    *   **International Strategy**: Low Integration, Low Responsiveness.
    *   **Multi-domestic Strategy**: Low Integration, High Responsiveness.
*   **Entry Modes (Risk/Investment increases left to right)**:
    *   Global Sourcing -> Exporting/Importing/Licensing/Franchising -> Strategic Alliance (Joint Venture) -> Foreign Subsidiary.

## Slide 3: International Strategy Options
*   **Multidomestic (Think Local, Act Local)**: Tailor to specific market conditions. Decentralized decision making.
*   **Global (Think Global, Act Global)**: Same basic strategy worldwide (low-cost/differentiation). Centralized strategic actions.
*   **Transnational (Think Global, Act Local)**: Combination. Standardized basic strategy but customized product offerings.

## Slide 4: Contingency Theory
*   **Mechanistic Structure**: For stable environments. Centralized authority, vertical communication, strict rules.
*   **Organic Structure**: For changing environments. Decentralized authority, horizontal communication, cross-departmental cooperation.

## Slide 5: Organization Design Model
*   **Flow**: External Environment (Opportunities/Threats) + Internal Situation (Strengths/Weaknesses) -> CEO/Top Management -> Strategic Direction (Mission/Goals) -> Organization Design (Structure, Systems, Tech, HR, Culture) -> Effectiveness Outcomes (Efficiency, Goal attainment).

## Slide 6: A System Perspective (Open Systems Model)
*   **Inputs**: Resources (from environment).
*   **Transformation Process**: Design Components (Strategy, Structure, Technology, HR Systems, Measurement Systems, Culture).
*   **Outputs**: Organization Effectiveness (Performance, stakeholder satisfaction).

## Slide 7: Organizing as a Management Function
*   **Organizing**: Arranging people and resources to work toward a goal.
*   **Formal Structure**: Official structure (Organization Chart showing division of work, supervisory relationships, etc.).
*   **Informal Structure**: Shadow organization, social network analysis.

## Slide 8: Organization Design and Change
*   **Purpose of Organizing**: Divide work, assign tasks, coordinate, cluster jobs, establish relationships/authority, allocate resources.

## Slide 9: Mechanistic vs Organic Design
*   **Comparison**:
    *   **Mechanistic**: Predictability, Centralized, Many rules, Narrow span of control, Specialized tasks, Formal coordination.
    *   **Organic**: Adaptability, Decentralized, Few rules, Wide span of control, Shared tasks, Informal coordination.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   **Delegation**: Distributing work.
    *   **Empowerment**: Allowing others to make decisions.
    *   **Centralization vs Decentralization**.
    *   **Tall Structure** (Narrow span) vs **Flat Structure** (Wide span).

## Slide 10: Structure Follows Strategy
*   **Key Questions**:
    *   Work Specialization (Division of tasks).
    *   Departmentalization (Grouping jobs).
    *   Chain of Command (Reporting lines).
    *   Span of Control (Number of direct reports).
    *   Centralization/Decentralization (Decision authority).
    *   Formalization (Rules and regulations).

## Slide 11: Principles of Effective Organization Design
*   5 Interrelated Components:
    1.  Leadership.
    2.  Decision-making and structure.
    3.  People.
    4.  Work processes and systems.
    5.  Culture.

## Slide 12: Organization Design Model (Star Model)
*   **Star Model Components**: Strategy, Structure, Processes/Lateral Links, Rewards, People (HR).
*   Detailed comparison of Mechanistic (Cost minimization, Formal, Traditional) vs Organic (Innovation, Flat, Enriched jobs) across these components.

## Slide 13: Departmentalization
*   **5 Common Forms**:
    *   **Functional**: By work performed (e.g., engineering, accounting).
    *   **Product**: By product area (e.g., footwear, apparel).
    *   **Customer**: By customer needs (e.g., wholesale, retail).
    *   **Geographic**: By location (e.g., North, South).
    *   **Process**: By work/customer flow (e.g., testing, payment).

## Slide 14: Decision Types and Roles
*   **Decision Types**:
    *   Type I: Decide and Inform (Leader decides alone).
    *   Type II: Consult and Decide (Leader gathers input, then decides).
    *   Type III: Decide by Consensus (Group decision).
    *   Type IV: Delegate Decision (Others decide).
*   **Decision Roles (RAPID-like)**:
    *   Decision Manager (Responsible for process/implementation).
    *   Consulted Participant (Provides expertise).
    *   Informed Participant (Needs to know outcomes).
    *   Approver (Veto power/quality check).

## Slide 15: Job Design Dimensions
*   **Job Design**: Specifying job usage and methods.
