- **Types of Resources**:
    - **Tangible**: Physical (Facilities, Equipment, Materials).
    - **Intangible**: IP, Human Capital, Social Capital (Relationships), Knowledge.

## Pages 21-22: VRIO Outcomes
- **Scenario Analysis**:
    1.  **If NOT Valuable (No V)** -> **Competitive Disadvantage**.
    2.  **If Valuable but NOT Rare (Yes V, No R)** -> **Competitive Parity** (Equality). We all have it (resource similarity).
    3.  **If Valuable, Rare, but NOT Inimitable (Yes V, Yes R, No I)** -> **Temporary Competitive Advantage**. (Others will copy it soon).
    4.  **If Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, but NOT Organized (Yes V, Yes R, Yes I, No O)** -> **Unused Competitive Advantage**.
    5.  **If ALL YES (V, R, I, O)** -> **Sustainable Competitive Advantage**.
        - Example: Apple iOS / Ecosystem.
